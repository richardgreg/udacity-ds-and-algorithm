I used the linked list data structure because the structure of a
blockchain is identical to that of a linked list. And methods have
been invented to operate on a linked list as efficiently as possible.

Adding a block to a blockchain appends to the last block. The worst
case of the operation is O(n), where n is the size of the blockchain.

Memory wise, using a linked list is efficient because the size of a
linked list is not preset.
