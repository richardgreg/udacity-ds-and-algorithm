I used a dictionary data structure because of the O(1) time complexity of
a dictionary data structure's retrieval and insertion operation.

The space complexity is O(n), where n is the capacity initiated during the
class creation. The time complexity is also O(n) due to the min method
that retrieves the least used cache.
